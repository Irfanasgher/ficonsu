															we can keep all their payroll records, providing them with
															payslips and end of year returns and ensuring all relevant
															forms and notices are completed and submitted electronically
															by the due dates. <br />
															Every employer must now have work place pension so that all
															eligible employees are auto enrolled into a pension scheme.
															When an employer pays a salary it has to make the
															appropriate deductions and pay this to the pension provider
															together with its employer contribution. We can set up and
															handle all aspects of Auto Enrolment as part of our payroll
															services.

														</h3>

															The H M Revenue & Customs are placing ever increasing

															been made correctly and on time you may still be selected.
															As the H M Revenue & Customs are spending more resources on
															investigations the number of investigations has been
															steadily growing which means the risk of being singled out
															is now greater. Accountants receive no formal training in
															dealing with the Revenue in respect of such investigations.
															If faced with an investigation you should seek the services
															of an Accountant with extensive experience in this field as

																		INTRODUCTION FOR THE SELF EMPLOYED
																	</h3>
																	<p>
																		One of the concerns people have when setting up
																		a business is the various taxes that will have
																		to be paid and returns that will have to be made
																		to the H M Revenue & Customs. Many people go
																		from a situation of having paid tax by deduction
																		under the PAYE system, to having to account for
																		and pay their own tax annually. In addition they
																		may have to account for VAT and/or PAYE on a
																		regular basis.
																	</p>
																	<p>
																		In setting up a business you are likely to ask
																		questions such as.
																	</p>
																	<ul>
																		<li>
																			<i class="finance-icon-check-square"></i>
																			How do I register for tax?
																		</li>
																		<li>
																			<i class="finance-icon-check-square"></i>
																			What income do I pay tax on?
																		</li>
																		<li>
																			<i class="finance-icon-check-square"></i>
																			How do I deduct Tax from my employees?
																		</li>
																		<li>
																			<i class="finance-icon-check-square"></i>
																			I am a Builder, How do I pay my
																			Subcontractors?

																	<h3 class="heading">KEEPING BOOKS & RECORDS</h3>
																	<h3 class="heading">
																		Am I obliged to keep records for tax purposes?
																	</h3>
																	<p>
																		Yes. You must keep full accurate records for
																		your business from the start. You need to do
																		this whether you send in simple summary of your
																		profit/loss, prepare the accounts yourself or
																		have an accountant do it for you. It is
																		important to remember that figures which are
																		contained in your tax returns, your accounts or
																		summary profits/losses, must be correct. The
																		records you keep must be sufficient to enable
																		you to make a proper return of income for tax
																		purposes.
																		<br />
																		You should bear in mind that you need to keep
																		accounts for other reasons other than tax, for
																		example, your bank may want to see them when
																		considering an application for a loan or
																		mortgage.
																	</p>
																	<h3 class="heading">What records must I keep?</h3>
																	<p>
																		The type of records you will need to keep will
																		depend on the nature and size of your business.
																		Business records can be kept on computerized
																		systems or manually.

																			out. Thses should be recorded in a manner
																			that will clearly show the amounts involved
																			and the matters to which they relate.
																		</li>
																	</ul>
																	<p>
																		All supporting records such as invoices, bank
																		and building society statements, cheque stubs,
																		receipts etc., should also be retained.All
																		payroll records must also be kept in the
																		prescribed format.

																	<h3 class="heading">
																		How should I record these transactions?
																	</h3>
																	<p>
																		In order to keep control of your transactions a
																		full “double entry” book keeping system is
																		recommended. Any system which falls short of
																		this should be capable of showing the amount and
																		source of:
																	</p>
																	<ul>
																		<li>
																			<i class="finance-icon-check-square"></i>
																			All income
																		</li>
																		<li>
																			<i class="finance-icon-check-square"></i>
																			All purchases and other outgoings
																		</li>
																	</ul>
																	<p>
																		Simply keeping the bank statements for the
																		business is not enough – it does not fulfil your
																		requirements to keep proper books and records.
																	</p>

																	<h3 class="heading">
																		What type of accounts will I have to submit with
																		my tax return?
																	</h3>
																	<p>You will need to submit:</p>
																	<ul>
																		<li>
																			<i class="finance-icon-check-square"></i>
																			A Profit & loss account Showing details of
																			income received less cost of the goods sold
																			less any various other expenses of trade
																			during the period, the difference being the
																			net profit/loss of the business for the
																			period
																		</li>
																		<li>
																			<i class="finance-icon-check-square"></i>
																			A Capital account Showing details of opening
																			and closing capital, net profit/loss for the
																			period, cash introduced and drawings
																		</li>
																		<li>
																			<i class="finance-icon-check-square"></i> A
																			Balance sheet setting out details of the
																			business assets and liabilities at the end
																			of the period.
																		</li>
																	</ul>
																	<p>
																		A capital account and balance sheet may not
																		always be required, depending on the
																		circumstances and level of your trading
																		activities.
																	</p>
																	<h3 class="heading">
																		If my business is small can I submit a
																		simplified form of accounts?
																	</h3>
																	<p>
																		Yes. If your business turnover is less than
																		£81,000 per year simplified accounts can be
																		submitted showing turnover and total expenses
																		giving net profit/loss for the period.
																	</p>
																	<h3 class="heading">
																		How long must I keep my records?
																	</h3>
																	<p>
																		You must keep your records for six years after
																		the end of the accounting period.
																	</p>
																	<h3 class="heading">
																		What happens if I fail to keep proper records?
																	</h3>
																	<p>
																		Failure to keep adequate records, or failure to
																		keep them for the necessary six years, is an
																		offence and you could be heavily fined,
																		typically £3,000.
																	</p>
																	<h3 class="heading">Do I need an Accountant?</h3>
																	<p>
																		It is not necessary to have an Accountant or Tax
																		Adviser in order to complete your tax returns
																		and claim the various allowances and relief’s
																		due to you. However, for specific advice on book
																		keeping and financial matters generally it would
																		be in your own interest to have an Accountant.
																		The tax office will normally correspond with
																		your Accountant regarding your tax affairs, if
																		you have one.

																	<h3 class="heading">REGISTERING FOR TAX</h3>
																	<h5>How do I register for Tax?</h5>
																	<p>
																		You should advise the tax office when you start
																		in business. This must be done within three
																		months of commencement otherwise a £100 fine
																		will be imposed. This must be done on line.
																	</p>

																	<h5>What if I decide to employ someone?</h5>
																	<p>
																		If you decide to employ someone you must
																		register as an employer for PAYE. <br />
																		Go to our Payroll page for further information.
																		<br />
																		Note if you set up a Company and have no
																		employees apart from yourself as the director
																		you still need to register as an employer.
																	</p>
																	<h5>Am I obliged to register for VAT?</h5>
																	<p>
																		You must register for VAT if you are a taxable
																		person and your annual turnover exceeds or is
																		likely to exceed £85,000. If your annual
																		turnover is less than the limits above, you may
																		still register if you so wish but this is not
																		compulsory. <br />
																		For further information see the Value Added Tax
																		page.
																	</p>

																	<h5>What tax number will I use?</h5>
																	<p>
																		If you set up a Company, the HM Revenue &
																		Customs will issue it with a separate Tax
																		Reference Number. Individuals who do not already
																		have a Tax Reference Number then one will be
																		issued that will be a unique number which will
																		not change in their life time.
																	</p>

																	<h5>
																		Can I keep the income tax relating to my
																		business separate from my job?
																	</h5>
																	<p>
																		Yes. If you already have a job, you can pay the
																		income tax due on your business activities
																		separately. Your income will of course, be
																		totaled for the purpose of determining the rate
																		at which you pay tax.
																	</p>

																	<h5>
																		Can I keep my tax affairs separate from my
																		spouse’s?
																	</h5>
																	<p>
																		Yes. Under self-assessment each person’s tax
																		affairs are confidential and separate from even
																		husband or wife.

																	<h3 class="heading">ACCOUNTING SOFTWARE</h3>
																	<p>
																		There are many Accounting Software packages
																		readily available from most PC Suppliers.
																	</p>
																	<p>
																		We recommend VT Transaction to all our clients.
																		We have been using VT Transaction for several
																		years and we have found it to be the most user
																		friendly package available. Other Packages can
																		be very complicated and in some cases requiring
																		several windows to complete simple tasks or
																		changes. In addition, VT Transaction has shown
																		to be very stable and flexible as practically
																		any aspect can be changed including the year
																		end, account names or nominal analysis details.
																	</p>
																	<p>
																		The package is inexpensive and is not upgraded
																		with features, that we find to be of no great
																		use, that require you to keep paying for the
																		newer version. Bookkeeping has not changed for
																		over a hundred years, so all most clients
																		require is a system that can process all the
																		business transactions, complete VAT Returns and
																		be able to provide all the relevant information
																		to their accountant in order for them to prepare
																		the year end accounts. VT Transaction in our
																		opinion is the best at delivering this.
																	</p>
																	<p>
																		We can provide the package to our clients or
																		they can purchase it direct from VT Transaction
																		using the following link
