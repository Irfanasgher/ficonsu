															</h3>

															<div class="accordion-content">
																<div>
																	Value added tax (VAT) is a consumer tax. It is collected by VAT registered traders on their supplies of goods and or services. Each trader pays VAT on goods and services acquired for the business and charges VAT on goods and services supplied by the business. The difference between the VAT charged by you and the VAT you were charged must be paid to the HM Revenue & Customs. If the amount of VAT paid by you exceeds the VAT charged by you the H M Revenue & Customs will repay you the excess. This ensures that VAT is paid by the ultimate customer and not by the business.

																		Must I register as an employer for PAYE if I employ staff?

																		Yes if you pay any employee <br />

																	<h3 class="heading">
																		When must I Account for and pay PAYE?
																	</h3>
																	<p>
																		The total tax deducted from employees pay together with any national insurance payable must be calculated on payments to the 5th of every month and paid over to the H M Revenue & Customs by the 19th of the month. For example, all amounts payable on payroll paid between 6 may and 5 June must be accounted for and paid by 19 June.
																	</p>
																	<h3 class="heading">
																		What do I have to do when I pay an employee
																	</h3>
																	<p>
																		On or before you pay an employee you must provide certain information, such as their gross pay and deductions direct to the HM Revenue & Customs. Which must be submitted on line. This is their system of REAL TIME INFORMATION (RTI). There are no end of year returns to complete except you must issue a form P60 to each employee who is still in your employment as at 5 April Each year.
																	</p>
																	<h3 class="heading">
																		PENSIONS & AUTO ENROLMENT
																	</h3>
																	<p>
																		All employers have to make provisions for their employees to pay into a work place pension scheme under auto enrolment. Each employer must have arrangements with an authorized pensions provider. They must assess every employee and auto enrol all those eligible. They must make appropriate deductions to salaries and pay over the pension deductions to the pension provider together with the employers’ contributions. This has to be done every time salaries are paid to employees.

																	<h3 class="heading">How is a company taxed?</h3>
																	<p>
																		Companies pay corporation tax. This tax is charged on the Company’s profits which include both income and chargeable gains. A Company’s income for tax purposes is basically calculated in accordance with income tax rules. Chargeable gains are basically calculated with capital gains tax rules.

																	</p>
																	<h3 class="heading">
																		What happens if the Company incurs a loss?
																	</h3>

																	<p>
																		If the Company incurs a loss it can offset those losses against any other income in the same year or against future years’ profits in the same business.

																		<br />
																		Companies must submit a corporation tax return no later than nine months after the end of the Company’s accounting year end date.

																	</p>
																	<h3 class="heading">
																		How do I go about setting up a company?
																	</h3>
																	<p>
																		If you wish to set up a Company, you would be best advised to talk to an Accountant first. All companies are registered with the registrar of companies at companies house. Once set up a Company is a legal entity separate from the persons who formed it, the directors or shareholders. Specialist agents can be found to set up a Company on your behalf or your Accountant should be able to help you in this respect.

																	</p>
																	<h3 class="heading">If I set up a Company, how will I be taxed as a director?</h3>
																	<p>
																		If you are a director of a company, you will probably be paid by the company and as such you will be an employee of the Company and your pay will be subject to normal deductions under PAYE.

																	</p>
																	<h3 class="heading">
																		How do I decide whether to trade as a sole trader or as a Company?
																	</h3>
																	<p>
																		There are many factors that should be considered before you set up a Company and your individual circumstances will dictate whether you should do so or not. In addition to the taxation issues, you need to consider, there are various other practical and legal matters which should be taken into account when setting up a Company and on which you should seek advice from your Accountant.

                                                                    <p>Subcontractors must provide the Contractor with their Date of Birth, Unique Taxpayer Reference and National Insurance Number.</p>
                                                                    <p>All Subcontractors should be issued with their Unique Tax Reference by the H M Revenue & Customs.</p>
                                                                    <p>New Subcontractors need to register with the H M Revenue & Customs either by phone, internet or in person. If they are unknown to the H M Revenue & Customs then they will have to go to a revenue office for an identity check. They will need to take two forms of ID with them. Each month the Contractor will hand to his Subcontractor a statement showing the amounts paid to him for that month together with a note of any tax deducted. The Subcontractor must keep this statement, as it his record of tax paid on his behalf, and pass this on to his Accountant in order for him to prepare his own Accounts.</p>

																	<h3 class="heading">Contractors Obligations</h3>
																	<p>
																		The first matter a Contractor must address is to determine whether the Subcontractor is actually a Subcontractor or an Employee. This is a gray area, as there is not one factor that determines whether a person should be treated as employed or as self-employed, as there are many that need to be considered. The H M Revenue & Customs may lead you to believe that, if a Subcontractor works for only one Contractor or he does not supply his own van or materials, he then must be an employee and cannot be self-employed. Do not be fooled by what you hear from the H M Revenue & Customs because if they had their way we ALL would be employed. YOU MUST SEEK ADVICE ON THIS ISSUE.
                                                                        <br />
                                                                        The Contractor must verify the Subcontractor with H M Revenue & Customs. They will be given a verification Number and be informed at what rate any deduction should be made. There are three rates of deduction, Zero, 20% & 30%.
                                                                        <br />
                                                                        Each month the Contractor is required to complete and submit a Return to H M Revenue & Customs within 14 days, giving details of all payments made to subcontractors in that month. This deadline is very important as any monthly returns submitted late will incur an immediate penalty of £100 and rising until the return is filed. These penalties are for any Contractor and it applies even when there have been no payments made to Subcontractors for the month.
                                                                        <br />
                                                                        Also when submitting the returns the Contractor must provide the Subcontractor with a statement showing the tax deducted on his behalf for that month.
                                                                        The Contractor does not submit annual returns as the monthly returns will contain all the relevant information.
                                                                        <br />
                                                                        All subcontractors that are registered for VAT are subject to the reverse VAT charge scheme for any work completed for a main contractor. If you are unsure of the requirements you must seek advice from your Accountant.
