																		What income will be included in my assessment?
																	</h3>
																	<p>
																		Your assessment to tax for any year is normally
																		based on your actual income earned in the tax
																		year i.e. from 6 April to the following 5 April.
																		<br />
																		If your income consists of profits from a trade,
																		professional or vocation, and your annual
																		accounts are normally made up to a date other
																		than 5 April, your assessment will be based on
																		the profits of your accounting year which ends
																		in the tax year. <br />
																		Example – If your accounts are prepared for the
																		twelve months ending on 31 December, the profits
																		for the period to 31 December 2020 will be taken
																		as your profits for the tax year 2021/2022.
																		However, the HMRC are currently in consultation
																		to amend this. <br />
																		The amount assessed in respect of any other
																		income, e.g. investment income, rental income
																		etc. is based on the actual income earned in the
																		tax year, i.e. from 6 April to 5 April.
																	</p>
																	<h3 class="heading">
																		What accounting date should I use?
																	</h3>
																	<p>
																		It is up to you to decide the date to which you
																		prepare your accounts. You can prepare your
																		accounts from the date your business started to
																		any date you choose. Once chosen you usually
																		prepare all future accounts to the same date
																		each year and this becomes your accounting year
																		end.
																	</p>
																	<h3 class="heading">
																		What happens if I need to change my accounting
																		year end date?
																	</h3>
																	<p>
																		As your business changes you may find that your
																		year-end date is inconvenient, for example it
																		may coincide with a time when it is your
																		busiest. In such circumstances you will be
																		allowed to change your year end. There are
																		special rules relating to change of accounting
																		date and the revenue will ensure no profits have
																		been left out as a result of the change.
																	</p>
																	<h3 class="heading">
																		What happens if I am in business with someone
																		else in partnership?
																	</h3>
																	<p>
																		If your business is a partnership, there are
																		special rules to calculate taxable profits. The
																		taxable profits of the partnership is calculated
																		and then divided between the partners in
																		accordance with the profit sharing agreement
																		they have made. Each individual partners tax
																		liability will then be calculated using the same
																		rules that apply to self-employed persons
																		working on their own.
																	</p>
																	<h3 class="heading">
																		How am I taxed in my start-up years?
																	</h3>
																	<p>
																		There are special rules for taxation of profits
																		in commencement years,
																	</p>
																	<h3 class="heading">First year</h3>
																	<p>
																		You are taxed on the profits of the business
																		from the date you started to the following 5
																		April.
																	</p>
																	<h3 class="heading">Second year</h3>
																	<p>
																		You are taxed on the profits of the twelve-month
																		period, ending in the second tax year. If there
																		is more than one accounting date end in the
																		second year special rules apply. You will be
																		taxed on the profits of the twelve months to the
																		latest accounting date ending in the year or on
																		the profits of the tax year. Where no accounts
																		are made up to a date in the second year you
																		will be taxed on the profits of the tax year.
																	</p>
																	<h3 class="heading">Third and subsequent years</h3>
																	<p>
																		You are taxed on the profits of your accounting
																		year ending in that tax year.
																	</p>
																	<h3 class="heading">What about my final years?</h3>
																	<p>
																		There are special rules relating to your final

																	<h3 class="heading">Who pays income tax?</h3>
																	<p>
																		Income tax is payable individuals on income
																		earned in the tax year. As an employee tax is
																		deducted from your salary through the PAYE
																		system. As a self-employed person you are
																		responsible for paying your own tax through the
																		self-assessment system. The tax year begins on
																		the 6 April and ends on 5 April in the following
																		year, e.g. the income tax year 2019/20 runs from
																		6 April 2019 to 5 April 2020.
																	</p>
																	<h3 class="heading">
																		On what income do I have to pay tax?
																	</h3>

																	<p>
																		You will pay tax on the annual profits or gains
																		from your trade, profession or vocation and on
																		any other income you might have. If your annual
																		accounts are normally made up to a date other
																		than 5 April, you will be taxed on the profits
																		of your accounting year e.g. if your accounts
																		are prepared for the twelve months ending on 31
																		December, the profits for the period which ends
																		in the tax year will be taken as your profits
																		for the tax year. There are special rules for
																		commencement and cessation years. See basis of
																		self-assessment page for further information.
																		<br />
																		You will also pay tax on any other income you
																		receive such as investment income, rental income
																		etc. This tax is based on the income earned in
																		the tax year, i.e. from 6 April to the following
																		5 April.
																	</p>
																	<h3 class="heading">
																		What tax and when will I have to pay it?
																	</h3>
																	<p>
																		As a self-employed person you will be taxed
																		under the self-assessment system. Under this
																		system you will:
																	</p>
																	<ul>
																		<li>
																			<i class="finance-icon-check-square"></i>
																			On 31 January in the tax year pay your first
																			payment on account of tax
																		</li>
																		<li>
																			<i class="finance-icon-check-square"></i>
																			On 31 July following the tax year pay your
																			second payment on account of tax
																		</li>
																		<li>
																			<i class="finance-icon-check-square"></i>
																		 On 31 January following the tax year pay
																			the balance of your tax due for the year
																		</li>
																		<li>
																			<i class="finance-icon-check-square"></i>
																			On 31 January following the tax year you
																			must also have submitted your
																			self-assessment tax return or you will incur
																			penalties.
																		</li>
																	</ul>
																	<p>
																		Note that the payments on account will equal the
																		previous year’s tax liability.
																	</p>
																	<h3 class="heading">Example - ongoing business</h3>
																	<p>
																		The tax liability for 2018/19 was £8,000 and
																		£10,000 for 2019/20, hence your tax payments for
																		2019/20 will be;
																	</p>
																	<ul>
																		<li>
																			<i class="finance-icon-check-square"></i>
																			31 January 2020 1st payment on account
																			£4,000
																		</li>

																		<li>
																			<i class="finance-icon-check-square"></i>
																			31 January 2021 balancing payment £2,000
																		</li>
																	</ul>
																	<p>
																		Note on 31 January 2021 you will also pay your
																		first payment on account for 2020/21 of £5,000
																	</p>
																	<h3 class="heading">
																		Will I be notified of my tax liability?
																	</h3>
																	<p>
																		Yes. As a self-employed person you will receive,
																		from the HM Revenue & Customs, a statement of
																		account showing amounts payable. These notices
																		are generally sent out in January and July.
																		However, it is your responsibility to ensure you
																		pay sufficient tax even if you do not receive
																		such a notice.
																	</p>
																	<h3 class="heading">
																		What happens if I do not pay my Tax on time?
																	</h3>
																	<p>
																		Interest is charged from the first day payment
																		is late plus a further 5% for amounts overdue by
																		28 days or more.
																	</p>

																	<h3 class="heading">
																		When must I submit my tax return?
																	</h3>
																	<p>
																		Under self-assessment you have a legal duty to
																		submit your tax return every year
																	</p>

																	<p>
																		The Inspector of taxes will issue tax returns to
																		all persons on record who are considered likely
																		to be liable for tax. However, it is your
																		responsibility to see to it that you get,
																		complete and submit your return on time.
																		<br />
																		Your tax return must be submitted by 31 October
																		following the tax year if you submit a paper
																		return, or 31 January following the tax year if
																		you submit your return on-line. The address to
																		which the return must be submitted will be on

																	<h3 class="heading">What are National Insurance Contributions?</h5>
																	<p>
																		Most people who work are liable to pay national insurance contributions unless they come into any of the groups excepted from liability to pay.
																	</p>
                                                                    <p>There are six classes of contributions in all, and the class you pay depends on whether you are an employee, self-employed, non-employed or an employer. Depending on your status you may have to pay more than one class of contribution at the same time.</p>
                                                                    <p>Self-employed persons are liable to pay two classes of contributions:</p>
                                                                    <ul>

																		<li>
																			<i class="finance-icon-check-square"></i>
																			Class 4 insurance contributions.
																		</li>
																	</ul>
																	<h5>Class 2 National Insurance Contributions</h5>
																	<p>
																		Class 2 contributions are a flat rate payment. The rate for 2021/2022 is £158.60 per year
                                                                        <br />
                                                                        Unless you have applied for and been granted a small earnings exception certificate or are a married woman or widow with reduced liability, you must pay class 2 contributions in respect of each week including holiday periods, if you are:

																	<h5>Class 4 National Insurance Contributions</h5>
																	<p>
																		If your profits are over a certain limit you may have to pay class 4 contributions as well as class 2 contributions. <br />
																		Class 4 contributions are based on annual profits and are calculated at two rates. The rates for 2021/22 are 9% between a lower and upper profit level and 2% for profits above the upper profit level. The levels are set each year by the government in the budget. For 2021/22 the levels are:

                                                                    <ul>

																			<i class="finance-icon-check-square"></i>
																			Lower profit level – £9,568
																		</li>
																		<li>
																			<i class="finance-icon-check-square"></i>
																			Upper profit level – £50,270
																		</li>
																	</ul>
																	<p>
																		Class 4 contributions are normally self-assessed in the same way as tax, and collected by the HM Revenue & Customs together with any Taxes due.

																	<h3 class="heading">ACCOUNTING SOFTWARE</h3>
																	<p>
																		There are many Accounting Software packages
																		readily available from most PC Suppliers.
																	</p>
																	<p>
																		We recommend VT Transaction to all our clients.
																		We have been using VT Transaction for several
																		years and we have found it to be the most user
																		friendly package available. Other Packages can
																		be very complicated and in some cases requiring
																		several windows to complete simple tasks or
																		changes. In addition, VT Transaction has shown
																		to be very stable and flexible as practically
																		any aspect can be changed including the year
																		end, account names or nominal analysis details.
																	</p>
																	<p>
																		The package is inexpensive and is not upgraded
																		with features, that we find to be of no great
																		use, that require you to keep paying for the
																		newer version. Bookkeeping has not changed for
																		over a hundred years, so all most clients
																		require is a system that can process all the
																		business transactions, complete VAT Returns and
																		be able to provide all the relevant information
																		to their accountant in order for them to prepare
																		the year end accounts. VT Transaction in our
																		opinion is the best at delivering this.
																	</p>
																	<p>
																		We can provide the package to our clients or
																		they can purchase it direct from VT Transaction
																		using the following link
