																		Inheritance Tax now affects millions of people,

																	<p>
																		Assets in excess of £325,000 could be liable to

																		Giving away your assets before you die may not
																		avoid Inheritance Tax.
																		<br />
																		For most UK residents this includes all assets
																		held in the UK and abroad.

																		Gifting your house while still living there will
																		not avoid an Inheritance Tax Charge.

																		The H M Revenue & Customs are placing greater
																		demands on the self-employed by increased red
																		tape and compliance provisions. This can be very
																		worrying since anyone can be selected at random
																		for an investigation. Even though you may have
																		done nothing wrong and all disclosures have been
																		made correctly and on time you can still be
																		selected. As the H M Revenue & Customs are
																		spending more resources on investigations the
																		number of investigations has been steadily
																		growing which means the risk of being singled
																		out is now greater. This is one of the main
																		reasons that all the self-employed need to
																		maintain adequate records so that proof of
																		financial transactions is readily available in
																		the event of an investigation. Accountants
																		receive no formal training in dealing with the
																		Revenue in respect of such investigations. If
																		faced with an investigation you should seek the
																		services of an Accountant with extensive
																		experience in this field as his knowledge gained
																		over the years will be invaluable when fighting
																		your corner.
																		<br />
																		We have over 20 years’ experience in dealing
																		with H M Revenue & Customs investigations. We
																		provide our clients with piece of mind knowing
																		it is in our hands from start to finish. We deal
																		with the H M Revenue & Customs direct and our
																		clients need not be in contact with them during
																		the investigation as we handle all aspects of
																		the investigation keeping our clients informed
																		of the progress.
